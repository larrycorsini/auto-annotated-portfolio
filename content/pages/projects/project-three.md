description: >-
  In this project, I deployed a Jellyfin media server within Proxmox VE to
  manage and stream personal media securely. Instead of relying on third-party
  services, I created a self-hosted solution that allows for full control over
  content organization, privacy, and streaming quality. The deployment was done
  within a virtualized environment for enhanced flexibility and scalability.

### **Project Overview:**

I set up **Jellyfin** in a Proxmox virtual machine, utilizing containerized deployments to ensure optimal resource allocation and isolation. Networking and port forwarding were configured to allow secure remote access from any device while maintaining strict security protocols. To streamline content management, I automated the media organization process, along with metadata retrieval, to improve the overall user experience.

### **Key Components:**

*   **Jellyfin** for managing and streaming media

*   **Proxmox VE** for virtualization and resource management

*   Secure **remote access** setup using Cloudflare Tunnel

*   Automated **media organization** and metadata fetching for a better user interface

*   Containerization for **efficient resource management**

### **Outcomes & Impact:**

*   Developed a reliable and scalable self-hosted media server

*   Enhanced the user experience through automated media organization and metadata fetching

*   Gained hands-on experience with **Proxmox VE** and **containerization** for media servers

*   Enabled secure streaming access without relying on third-party cloud services

*   Streamlined the process of managing a growing media library

This project was an exciting challenge in self-hosting and virtualization, as it allowed me to explore and set up an environment that could evolve over time to support more features and services.
