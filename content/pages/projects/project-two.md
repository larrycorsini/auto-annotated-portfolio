  This project involved designing and implementing a Proxmox VE-based lab
  environment with a focus on network segmentation and security. I integrated a
  series of tools to manage and optimize the network's performance while
  ensuring a high level of security and monitoring. The core components of the
  lab included an OPNsense firewall/router and centralized monitoring using
  Pi-hole, Prometheus, and Grafana.

### **Project Overview:**

The lab was designed to simulate a secure and optimized network environment, with strict segmentation between different parts of the network to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities. The **OPNsense firewall** was configured as the central point for routing and security, and services like **Pi-hole** were used to enhance network privacy by blocking unwanted content. Additionally, **Prometheus** and **Grafana** were integrated to monitor system performance, ensuring real-time insights into the health of the network.

### **Key Components:**

*   **Proxmox VE** for managing virtualized environments

*   **OPNsense** for firewall and routing management

*   **Pi-hole** for network-wide ad-blocking and privacy

*   **Prometheus** for system and network monitoring

*   **Grafana** for visualizing system metrics and network performance

*   Network segmentation for enhanced security

### **Outcomes & Impact:**

*   Built a scalable and flexible virtualized network environment

*   Gained practical experience in network security, virtualization, and system monitoring

*   Optimized network performance through centralized monitoring and ad-blocking

*   Ensured network security with proper segmentation and firewall management

*   Created a lab that could evolve to support more complex configurations in the future

This project was an important step in refining my skills in network management, security, and monitoring, helping me create a robust, isolated virtualized lab to test various configurations and network setups.
