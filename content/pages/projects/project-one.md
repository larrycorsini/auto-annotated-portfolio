  In this project, I used Cloudflare Tunnel to securely access OPNsense,
  bypassing traditional VPN solutions. The goal was to establish secure remote
  network access to my homelab without exposing sensitive infrastructure to the
  public internet. The Cloudflare Tunnel ensures encrypted communication between
  my devices and OPNsense while maintaining network privacy.
